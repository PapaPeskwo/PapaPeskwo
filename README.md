## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tomislav, a DevOps engineer student who's still trying to figure out what DevOps actually means. But hey, I'm here to optimize the heck out of your deployment pipeline! When I'm not writing automation scripts, you can find me trying to automate my coffee-making process or arguing with my classmates about the best way to name things. Let's connect and have a laugh over some coffee (or beer, I'm not picky) - unless, of course, you're one of those people who puts pineapple on pizza. We might have to have a serious discussion about that.
